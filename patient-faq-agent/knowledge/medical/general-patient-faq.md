# General Patient FAQ

## Appointment Scheduling

**Q: How far in advance should I schedule routine checkups?**
A: For routine annual physicals, schedule 2-3 months in advance. For specialists, allow 4-6 weeks. Urgent care is available for immediate needs that can't wait for a regular appointment.

**Q: What should I bring to my appointment?**
A: Bring your insurance card, photo ID, current medication list (including over-the-counter drugs and supplements), and any relevant medical records or test results from other providers.

**Q: How should I prepare for a blood test?**
A: Follow your doctor's specific instructions. Some tests require fasting for 8-12 hours (only water allowed). Wear a shirt with sleeves that can be rolled up easily.

## Medication Questions

**Q: What should I do if I miss a dose of medication?**
A: Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it's almost time for your next dose. Never double up on doses. Consult your pharmacist or doctor for specific guidance about your medication.

**Q: Can I stop taking medication if I feel better?**
A: No, always complete the full course of prescribed medication, especially antibiotics. Stopping early can lead to treatment failure or antibiotic resistance. Consult your doctor before making any changes.

**Q: What should I do if I experience side effects?**
A: Contact your healthcare provider if you experience any concerning side effects. For severe reactions like difficulty breathing, swelling, or severe rash, seek emergency medical attention immediately.
