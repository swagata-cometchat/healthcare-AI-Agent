## üöÄ Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+ installed
- OpenAI API key
- Basic understanding of Mastra framework

### Installation
1. Clone this repository
2. Navigate to any agent directory
3. Install dependencies: `npm install`
4. Set up environment variables (see individual agent READMEs)
5. Start the development server: `npx mastra dev`

### Environment Setup
Each agent requires an `.env` file with your OpenAI API key:
```env
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here
```

## üóÇ Cloning & Running an Individual Agent

Follow these steps to work with any single agent in this monorepo-style collection.

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-org/healthcare-AI-Agent.git
cd healthcare-AI-Agent
```
(Replace the URL with the actual repository URL if different.)

### 2. Choose an Agent Directory
Available agent folders:
- patient-faq-agent
- human-handoff-agent
- coordinator-agent-healthcare
- patient-onboarding-workflow-agent

Example (run the Patient FAQ Agent):
```bash
cd patient-faq-agent
```

### 3. Install Dependencies
```bash
npm install
```

### 4. Set Environment Variables
Create a `.env` file in the agent folder (if one does not already exist):
```bash
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here
```
Add any other keys required by that specific agent (see its README if present).

### 5. Start the Agent in Dev Mode
All agents expose a dev script:
```bash
npm run dev
```
This runs the Mastra dev server (defaults to port 4111 unless configured otherwise). Check the console output for the exact URL.

### 6. Test the Agent Endpoint
Use the appropriate endpoint for the agent you started. Example (Patient FAQ Agent):
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:4111/api/agents/patient-faq/generate \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"messages":[{"role":"user","content":"What are symptoms of dehydration?"}]}'
```

### 7. Stop the Server
Press Ctrl+C in the terminal.

---

## üîÅ Running a Different Agent
From the repo root:
```bash
cd human-handoff-agent && npm install && npm run dev
```
(or substitute another folder name.)

## üß© Install All Agents (Optional Convenience)
If you want to install dependencies for all agents at once:
```bash
for d in patient-faq-agent human-handoff-agent coordinator-agent-healthcare patient-onboarding-workflow-agent; do \
  (cd $d && npm install); \
done
```
Then start whichever one you need by entering its folder and running `npm run dev`.

## üîß Common Issues When Running
- Missing OPENAI_API_KEY: Ensure `.env` exists in the agent directory
- Port already in use: Stop other running agents or set a different port via environment or config
- Dependency errors: Re-run `npm install`
